Overview

The project utilizes the website https://www.saucedemo.com/, commonly used for learning test automation. In the project, I use Java with Selenium and TestNG framework. The tests cover basic functionalities commonly found in an e-commerce store, including login, adding items to the cart, making purchases, sorting, viewing the cart, etc. After executing the tests, a report is generated, which can be viewed in the extent.html file.
